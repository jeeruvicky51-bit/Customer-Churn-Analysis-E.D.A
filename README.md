📊 Teco Customer Churn Analysis
🧠 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical business problem in the telecom industry, where retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
This project focuses on analyzing churn patterns for Teco Telecom to identify the key factors influencing customer churn and to recommend actionable strategies for improving customer retention.

🎯 Objective

To analyze customer data and discover which factors — such as contract type, payment method, tenure, and demographics — contribute most to customer churn, and to provide data-driven recommendations to minimize churn.

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

•Programming Language: Python

•Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

•Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

•Techniques: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning, Data Visualization

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains telecom customer information including:

•Customer ID

•Gender, Senior Citizen

•Contract Type (Month-to-Month, One Year, Two Year)

•Payment Method (Electronic Check, Credit Card, Bank Transfer, Mailed Check)

•Internet Service Type (DSL, Fiber Optic)

•Tenure (Months with Company)

•Monthly Charges, Total Charges

•Churn Label (Yes/No)

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The analysis included:

•Checking data quality (missing values, data types, outliers)

•Visualizing churn patterns using bar plots, line graphs, and pie charts

•Understanding correlations between customer behavior and churn

📈 Key Insights & Findings
1️⃣ Contract Type and Churn

•Month-to-Month customers have the highest churn rate (42%).

•One-Year and Two-Year contracts show lower churn rates of 11% and 3% respectively.
➡️ Long-term contracts significantly improve customer retention.

2️⃣ Payment Method

•Customers using Electronic Checks churned the most (45%).

•Other payment methods (Credit Card, Bank Transfer, Mailed Check) averaged around 15–18% churn.
➡️ Trust and convenience in payment methods are crucial to retention.

3️⃣ Customer Tenure

•Churn is highest in the first year (50%), gradually declining to 15% after 3 years.
➡️ Customer engagement in early months is key to long-term loyalty.

4️⃣ Internet Service Type

•Fiber Optic users churn more (30%) than DSL users (20%).
➡️ Service satisfaction and quality perception may drive churn.

5️⃣ Senior Citizens

•Senior Citizens (65+) show 41% churn, compared to 26% among non-seniors.
